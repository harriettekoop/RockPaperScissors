# Rock Paper Scissors
In this small Python project I built a program that plays Rock Paper Scissors.  It was part of the Udacity Nanodegree Introduction to Programming.

This text-based game runs in the console and accepts player input.

The game has multiple modes where you can play against:
- a computer opponent that always plays 'rock' (RockPlayer)
- a computer opponent that returns rock, paper or scissors at random (RandomPlayer)
- a computer opponent that copies your previous move (ReflectPlayer)
- a computer opponent that cycles through a predefined list of moves (CyclePlayer)
- another human player (HumanPlayer)
