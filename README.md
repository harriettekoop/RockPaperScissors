# Rock Paper Scissors
In this small Python project I built a program that plays Rock Paper Scissors.  It was part of the Udacity Nanodegree Introduction to Programming.

It is a text based game that can be played in the console. The game asks for input of the player(s).

The game has multiple modes, where you can play either:
- Against a computer opponent that always plays 'rock' (RockPlayer)
- Against a computer opponent that returns rock, paper or scissors at random (RandomPlayer)
- Against a computer opponent that returns your previous move as it's own move (ReflectPlayer)
- Against a computer opponent that everytime returns a move from a predefined list of moves (CyclePlayer)
- Against another human player (HumanPlayer)
